# -Honey-Bee-Design-patterns
Implemented various design patterns-
    1)Singleton
    2)Builder design pattern
    3)Abstract factory pattern
    4)Decorator Pattern:
• An apiary can have many beehives in them.
• An apiary is capable of spawning a logically unlimited number of beehives.
• A beehive is comprised of a network of hives or rooms and a beehive can’t
contain another beehive.
• A beehive have hives for spawning more bees.
• Bees are able to battle other bees (unconventional). When they do, the loser
of the battle die (it’s beehives can no longer command it), and the winner
of the battle get the attributes of the bee.
• A beehive only have one species of bees. Each species should have some
kind of bonus to them. Perhaps they harvest nectar from flowers faster. Perhaps
they have a higher chance to kill other bees.
